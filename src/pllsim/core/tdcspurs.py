"""Deterministic fractional-spur prediction from TDC nonlinearity.

The TDC-based ADPLL has no DTC code sequence to replay, which is why its
analyze() used to hand back an empty spur table and a note saying to read
the number out of simulate().  The mechanism is nonetheless just as
deterministic as the DTC case, and it is worth being able to see before
running anything.

With a fractional FCW the TDC input sweeps one oscillator period at the
fractional beat rate: the position inside that period is

    u[n] = (n * frac) mod 1 ,

so any systematic INL is a fixed function g(u) sampled along that ramp.
Expand g in a Fourier series on [0, 1),

    g(u) = sum_k c_k exp(j 2 pi k u) ,

and each harmonic maps to a tone at fold(k*frac)*fref -- one spur per k,
with amplitude |c_k| in seconds at the PD input.  Referring that to the
output through the loop's own response,

    spur [dBc] = 20 log10( 2*pi*fout*|c_k| * |NTF(f_spur)| / 2 ) ,

the same accounting core.dtcspurs uses.  Nothing here is fitted: the
coefficients come from the declared INL shape, and integer k*frac values
(the near-integer channels) land the spur inside the loop bandwidth where
|NTF| ~ 1, which is exactly where the measurement is worst.

The one thing that is easy to get wrong is *which* variable the INL is a
function of.  TDCConfig declares the shape over the converter's code range,
but the loop only ever walks one oscillator period of it -- and a TDC is
deliberately built with range > Tosc, so that is a fraction

    span = Tosc / (code_max * t_lsb)  <  1

of the declared axis.  A shape with a whole number of cycles across the range
therefore presents a *fractional* number of cycles to the loop, which is
discontinuous at the wrap and so spreads over every k instead of leaving a
single line.  Ignoring the span overstates the worst spur (4.3 dB for the
100 MHz ADPLL preset) and misses the harmonics entirely.
